| Description |
-----------
Web3 is currently a hot topic in the market. Even more important is how stable crypto currencies are and what their future price will be.

With a dash of FinTech, Machine Learning, and web3, we created the project StockCastery, which is a one-stop place for all your crypto watch, tracking, and prediction needs.

We used React to build the frontend, Material UI for style, Chart JS to construct the graph, Axios to fetch data from API, CoinGeko API for data, Tensorflow Framework & Keras Model to build the prediction model, Ski Kit Learn to analyse future data, and Vercel to host the website. And I'm very happy to share that we now have more than 70% accuracy across practically all crypto shares prediction, and we plan to strengthen this model in the next days.

Our approach is also open source, and our website is free. We do not require you to login or register. We are not requesting information about your wallet. The website is entirely free, responsive, and simple to use.
